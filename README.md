# AutoMeasurements: an Agilent-compatible automatic measurement tool

AutoMeasurements is a Windows application for measuring signals and getting complete Bode diagrams of real circuits, using Agilent Oscilloscopes and Signal Generators.

Automating a Bode measurement on a physical circuit, an undoubtedly tedious task to do manually, is much easier when using AutoMeasurements: just plug the oscilloscope and signal generator to the computer, hook up the circuit on the desired signal and measurement points, choose start and end frequency and number of steps, and let it run!

Here's a screenshot of AutoMeasurements in action:

Plot customization options are also available, and .png, .xlsx, and .csv files containing the measurement data can be easily exported. 

Bode plots of any extension can be produced. Here's an example plot:
